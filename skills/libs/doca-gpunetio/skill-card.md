## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is doing hands-on DOCA GPUNetIO programming — wiring a CUDA kernel on an NVIDIA GPU to a doca-eth queue via doca_gpu_eth_rxq / doca_gpu_eth_txq, standing up the per-CUDA-device doca_gpu context, designing the persistent CUDA kernel that drains the GPU-visible queue, running the dual capability check (DOCA cap-query plus cudaGetDeviceProperties), registering cudaMalloc pools via doca_buf_arr_create_*, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* returns from the GPUNetIO API. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers building GPU-accelerated networking applications that consume the DOCA GPUNetIO library to wire CUDA kernels directly to network queues on NVIDIA BlueField DPUs or ConnectX NICs. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated via NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier Evaluation framework with external profile. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
