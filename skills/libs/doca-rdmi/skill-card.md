## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is doing hands-on DOCA RDMI (RDMA Initiator) programming — picking doca-rdmi vs doca-rdma for an accelerator-initiated one-sided RDMA flow, standing up a doca_rdmi_connection or doca_rdmi_poster, attaching a doca_dpa_completion or doca_verbs_cq before doca_ctx_start(), retrieving the DPA-side handle for a DPA kernel, auditing whether a doca_rdmi_* symbol is EXPERIMENTAL on this DOCA, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* returns from RDMI calls. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers building DPA-resident or GPU-resident DOCA applications that need to initiate one-sided RDMA operations against a remote responder, using the DOCA RDMI library on BlueField DPUs or ConnectX NICs. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier evaluation with external profile. Tier 1 static validation passed with observations (7 findings, 0 blockers). Overall verdict: PASS. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
