## Description: <br>
Use this skill for DOCA Flow on a supported NVIDIA NIC/DPU — both for DOCA Flow application knowledge and for writing Flow applications: defining match/action pipes, bringing up ports/representors, forwarding with FWD_PORT, reading flow counters, validating a pipe before hardware programming, picking the right Flow version against an installed DOCA, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* from the Flow API. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers and engineers writing applications that consume the DOCA Flow library to program packet steering on a supported NVIDIA NIC/DPU with DOCA installed. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
3-Tier evaluation via NVSkills-Eval (`external` profile). Tier 1 static validation passed with observations. Tier 3 live agent evaluation not available in this report. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
