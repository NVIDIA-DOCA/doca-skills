## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is doing hands-on DOCA Erasure Coding programming on a BlueField DPU, ConnectX NIC, or host — bringing up a doca_ec context, picking among the create / recover / update tasks, choosing matrix type / N / K / block size, querying doca_ec_cap_* before sizing, setting doca_mmap src/dst permissions, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* returns from doca_ec_task_*. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers building applications that consume the DOCA Erasure Coding library to offload Reed-Solomon erasure coding onto a BlueField DPU or ConnectX accelerator for distributed storage resilience workloads. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier Evaluation (external profile). Overall verdict: PASS. Tier 1 static validation passed with observations. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
