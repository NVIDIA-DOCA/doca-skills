## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is dropping below the higher-level DOCA libraries (doca-rdma / doca-eth / doca-rmax) into the raw-verbs escape hatch — managing QP / CQ / PD / MR / SRQ / AH / CC-group / Ethernet-SQ-RQ primitives inside DOCA Core, porting libibverbs code into the DOCA Core model, capability-querying a specific verb / opcode / WR flag / QP attribute via doca_verbs_query_device, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* from doca_verbs_* calls. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers building applications that consume the DOCA Verbs library for raw QP / CQ / PD / MR / SRQ / Address-Handle / CC-group / Ethernet-SQ-RQ control inside a DOCA Core context, porting libibverbs code into the DOCA Core model, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* from doca_verbs_* calls. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated via NVSkills-Eval `external` profile (Tier 1 static validation: 1 check, 7 findings). Overall verdict: PASS. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
