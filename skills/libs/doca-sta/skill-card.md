## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is doing hands-on NVMe-over-Fabrics storage-target work on a BlueField DPU or ConnectX NIC with DOCA STA — standing up a doca_sta DOCA Core context that accelerates the target-side NVMe-oF data path over RDMA, defining doca_sta_subsystem targets (NQN + namespaces) backed by local NVMe-PCI backend disks (doca_sta_be), checking device support via doca_sta_cap_is_supported, sizing the per-connection I/O queues, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* from a STA call. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers building NVMe-over-Fabrics storage targets that consume DOCA STA on BlueField — users whose code calls doca_sta_* to accelerate the target-side data path of an NVMe-oF target on BlueField hardware, presenting doca_sta_subsystem targets backed by local NVMe-PCI disks to remote initiators over RDMA. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated via NVSkills-Eval external profile with 3-Tier Evaluation. Overall verdict: PASS. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
