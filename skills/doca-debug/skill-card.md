## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is debugging any DOCA symptom — a build that won't compile, a link step that can't resolve a doca_* symbol, a runtime call returning DOCA_ERROR_*, a silent service or tool, or a stack trace / valgrind / core dump — and needs the layered ladder (install → version → build → link → runtime → program), verbosity controls, container-debug constraints, or how to capture state for a Developer Forum post. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers debugging DOCA symptoms — build failures, link errors, runtime DOCA_ERROR_* codes, silent services, stack traces, and core dumps — using a structured layered debug ladder and verbosity controls. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
