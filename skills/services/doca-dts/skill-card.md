## Description: <br>
Deploys and configures the NVIDIA DOCA Telemetry Service (DTS) across its three deployment shapes — BlueField built-in kubelet static pod, host docker container, and DPF DPUService/helm chart — plus the shared dts_config.ini configuration layer of providers, exporters, and level labels. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers, infrastructure engineers, and DPU/cluster operators use this skill to deploy, configure, upgrade, and debug the DOCA Telemetry Service on BlueField, on an x86_64/aarch64 docker host, or inside a DPF-managed cluster, including tuning providers, exporters, and level labels through the shared configuration layer. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
6 evaluation tasks (4 positive, 2 negative), each attempt run in its own isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use, checking for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the expected skill was loaded when needed and decoys were avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the task, as the equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
