## Description: <br>
Guides users through verifying a DOCA install is healthy, preparing the build and runtime environment (pkg-config, headers, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, hugepages, devlink, representors), debugging env-class failures, deciding container-vs-bare-metal deployment shape, and reaching a DOCA install from a host that does not have one via the NGC DOCA container fallback. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers working with NVIDIA DOCA on BlueField DPUs who need to set up, verify, or troubleshoot their DOCA environment before writing application code. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier Evaluation with external profile; Tier 1 static validation passed with observations. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>



## Testing Completed: <br>
