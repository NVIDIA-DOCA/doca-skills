## Description: <br>
Use this skill when bringing up, configuring, hardening, or debugging `doca_flow_grpc` — the DOCA-shipped gRPC remote-control surface in front of `doca-flow` that lets non-C++ clients (Python, Go, Rust, Java) program Flow pipes and entries over RPC instead of linking `libdoca_flow.so` directly. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Control-plane developers, platform operators, and AI agents who need to program a running DOCA Flow pipeline from a non-C++ process across a network boundary using gRPC instead of linking libdoca_flow.so directly. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated with NVSkills-Eval `external` profile; Tier 1 static validation passed with 7 findings across 1 check. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
