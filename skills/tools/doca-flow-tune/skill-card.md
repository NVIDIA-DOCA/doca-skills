## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is tuning a live or captured doca-flow pipeline with doca_flow_tune — snapshotting pipe / counter / KPI state, picking a tuning axis (rule placement, resource hints / table sizing, HW-offload mode) and a matching measurement (rule-install rate, lookup latency, hardware-counter delta), running offline or online (read-only or state-changing) modes, reading the dumper CSV / analyze JSON / visualize mermaid, or applying a recommendation back into the Flow program. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External operators, performance engineers, DOCA Flow application developers, and AI agents who need to understand, characterize, or improve a running doca-flow pipeline's behavior on the user's actual install and device. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated via NVSkills-Eval external profile with Tier 1 static validation. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
