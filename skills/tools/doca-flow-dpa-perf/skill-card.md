## Description: <br>
Use this skill when invoking doca_flow_dpa_perf on DPA-capable hardware (ConnectX-7+ or BlueField-3) to measure rule update / disable rates on the DPA-offloaded DOCA Flow path, picking the active / passive device split, choosing workload-shape axes, or reading Kops/sec iteration stats and the optional self-test. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External operators, performance engineers, and DOCA Flow application developers measuring the DPA-offloaded Flow rule update / disable rate on DPA-capable hardware (ConnectX-7+ or BlueField-3) to produce defensible Kops/sec baselines and compare against the host / DPU-CPU Flow path. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated via NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier framework with external profile. Tier 1 static validation passed with observations (1 check, 7 findings, 0 blockers). Overall verdict: PASS. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
